### Getting Started

This project is written in JAVA using NetBeans IDE In these project user can log in or can create new account
and get into conversion of text and images


The project consists of two parts 

**1.GUI designing**


    You will get different JForms used here for designing GUI

    All the files ending with .form are just GUI files 
    
**2. Core Logic of Program:**

    Files ending with .java file are files which consist core logic. 

    EnglishToMorse.java and MorseToEnglish.java are files that convert normal English text to Morse Code and
    vice-versa chk.java is a file which will convert an image into Black and White image and determine if
    there are any dashes or dots in the image and count them(Because Morse contains only dashes and dots).

[EnglishToMorse.java](https://github.com/Kadam-Tushar/Morse-Code-Reader/blob/master/Project/MorseCode/MorseCodenew/src/EnglishToMorse.java) and [MorseToEnglish.java](https://github.com/Kadam-Tushar/Morse-Code-Reader/blob/master/Project/MorseCode/MorseCodenew/src/MorseToEnglish.java) are files that convert normal English text to Morse Code and vice-versa 

[chk.java](https://github.com/Kadam-Tushar/Morse-Code-Reader/blob/master/Project/MorseCode/MorseCodenew/src/chk.java) is a file which will convert an image into Black and White image and determine if there are any dashes or dots in the image       and count them(Because Morse contains only dashes and dots).

**So basically flow of the project is explained in following image:**
